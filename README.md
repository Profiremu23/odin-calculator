# odin-calculator
The time has arrived. My final project for the Odin Project's (TOP) Foundations course.

It will be a modest calculator that I will create to show off all of my skills that I learned from the Odin Project since the beginning from March 2023. I have come through ups and downs, and one point I got frustrated and given up from programming for two months, before returning in August to resume my progress towards TOP and programming in general, and this is here I am at making this project.
